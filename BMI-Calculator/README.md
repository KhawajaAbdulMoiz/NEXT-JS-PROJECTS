Welcome to the BMI Calculator project! 
This simple yet effective application allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height. With a clean and user-friendly interface, it's designed to help individuals understand their weight status and make informed health decisions. 🌟

## Project Overview

The BMI Calculator takes user inputs for weight (in kg) and height (in meters) to compute the BMI and categorize it into different ranges: Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, and Obese. This project serves as a great example of utilizing React and Next.js for building interactive web applications.
